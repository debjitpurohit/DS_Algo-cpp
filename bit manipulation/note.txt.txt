why we use bit ??
  --> if we use bits,  programm will be computationally more faster than decimal.
      if we decleare a decimal, computer first convert it into binary/bit then do 
      the operation so we directly use bit opearation to do program , thats why 
      program will more fast (less time complexcity).
